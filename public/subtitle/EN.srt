1
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,293
Are you obedient?

2
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:34,748
Are you?

3
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:37,377
You will be the captain then.

4
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:40,585
All right, let's get ready to go.

5
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:43,668
My students.

6
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,125
From now on,

7
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,168
you are on the same team.

8
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:48,833
When we get there later,

9
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,708
don't run around,

10
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:50,708
don't look elsewhere,

11
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:51,585
and don't talk nonsense.

12
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,417
Do you still remember our school motto?

13
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,668
These are the members of our team.

14
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,542
I'm Zhang Wei,

15
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:00,542
one of the five students named "Zhang Wei" in Shaohai Third High School.

16
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,248
I'm the most ordinary one among them.

17
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:04,793
I don't have many hobbies,

18
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,168
nor any particular goal.

19
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,125
My results are fine.

20
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,833
I'm telling you. You are not fine.

21
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,168
Students like you are the most troublesome.

22
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,585
You are neither up nor down,

23
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:16,917
neither good nor bad.

24
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,293
Do you think you can slack off as a junior?

25
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:23,002
Let me tell you.

26
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:24,748
It will be too late when you become a senior.

27
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:26,793
In your case...

28
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:28,417
I got 24 marks.

29
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:30,125
Ququ is my best friend.

30
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,793
He is naturally hyperactive

31
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,333
and simple minded.

32
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,462
Come. Come on.

33
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:39,462
Qu Xiaodong!

34
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,542
Get up!

35
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:44,377
You came in last in the class.

36
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,042
What is there to be proud of?

37
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,002
Go and stand at the back.

38
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,293
In this exam...

39
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,748
He always takes our self study class.

40
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,668
Don't you think Mr. Xia is crazy?

41
00:02:58,748 --> 00:02:59,462
If he didn't drag me

42
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:01,085
to join the school swimming team,

43
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,462
I might never have the courage

44
00:03:03,877 --> 00:03:06,168
to escape from those annoying self study classes.

45
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:13,042
There's also Wang Zi who just transferred from the Northeast.

46
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:17,748
Let me show you

47
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:20,877
what is "good looks sealed away by glasses."

48
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:23,333
He has a dorky personality.

49
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:26,748
Are you still recruiting members?

50
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:28,042
He is someone

51
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,208
who loves to make friends.

52
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:30,502
Let me join you.

53
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,248
Next is Chen Minghan of Class 1, a junior.

54
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,917
The overall top scorer is Chen Minghan again.

55
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:43,542
He always ranked first in various subjects.

56
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,208
Chen Minghan,I'm not asking about the subject.

57
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:49,462
I'm asking about your hobby.

58
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:50,748
I'm talking about my hobby.

59
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,542
Trigonometric functions are my hobby.

60
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,293
He could be the "model child"

61
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:56,585
my mom often talks about.

62
00:03:58,293 --> 00:03:59,208
Gao Fei.

63
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:01,502
He is the best sports student at our school.

64
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:05,293
Yet he refused to join any sports clubs.

65
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,042
In everyone's eyes,

66
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,877
he looks cool and mysterious.

67
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:18,125
It's on fire!

68
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:18,502
What?

69
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:20,042
Your shirt is on fire!

70
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:28,708
What happened?

71
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,417
Did you do this?

72
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:33,793
I?

73
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:37,962
There was a loose thread on your shirt.

74
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,585
Mr. Kui is our coach.

75
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:45,962
He is passionate about his job.

76
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:47,502
He is overenthusiastic

77
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,085
in all that he does.

78
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,502
You have to get me two swimmers from the team.

79
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,668
During the High School Water Sports Meeting,

80
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:53,833
However, with too much enthusiasm,

81
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,542
it's easy

82
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:57,502
to be sleepy.

83
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:00,377
under the premise of ensuring the quality of learning.

84
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:01,708
So we are hoping that

85
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,002
each school will look at their own circumstances

86
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,333
and put together this men's?

87
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:07,417
It's "women's."

88
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:09,462
No.

89
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,333
It's a women's synchronized swimming team.

90
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:13,002
Of course.

91
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,042
If there is any school that would want to form a men's team,

92
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,668
we would welcome it equally.

93
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:22,877
This has an innovative meaning to it.

94
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:26,625
Instead of focusing on college entrance exams

95
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:28,248
What did the chief just say?

96
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,248
About forming a men's synchronized swimming team.

97
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,168
The chief was just joking?

98
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,917
The other schools formed women's teams?

99
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:47,668
It's just our school that formed a men's team?

100
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:51,417
I got it.

101
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,002
Okay.

102
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:58,042
Okay, bye.

103
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:07,168
How can you not even know the gender?

104
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:08,877
The chief was joking.

105
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,042
Couldn't you tell?

106
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,917
There's not a single men's synchronized swimming team

107
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:14,917
in this country that is complete.

108
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:16,085
If that's the case,

109
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,748
what should we do now?

110
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,625
What else can we do?

111
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,625
We have already submitted it.

112
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:21,502
You should recruit the members first.

113
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,293
Don't let the headmaster find out

114
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:24,793
that there are not enough members.

115
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,125
Okay.

116
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,585
How many have you recruited?

117
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:29,917
Five.

118
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:31,293
We already have five members.

119
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:40,042
The five of you

120
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:42,462
must show the good mental health

121
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:44,248
of high school students.

122
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,462
Right.

123
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,168
Welcome to the Men's Synchronized Swimming Team.

124
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:53,085
I'm in Class 2.

125
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:53,962
My surname is Wang.

126
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:55,085
I'm Wang Zi.

127
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,462
I'm in Class 7.

128
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:57,293
My surname is "Father."

129
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,502
I'm "King Father."

130
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,002
Isn't this a swimming team?

131
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,377
How did it become synchronized swimming?

132
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:14,293
Synchronized swimming

133
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:16,333
is also known as water ballet.

134
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,293
It originated in Europe.

135
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:19,502
It started

136
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:21,293
as a performance

137
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:23,002
during the intervals of swimming competitions.

138
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,002
It is highly artistic

139
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,417
and requires certain techniques,

140
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,377
along with dancing and strength basics.

141
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:29,542
In general,

142
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,962
synchronized swimming is divided into

143
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:31,462
solo,

144
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,293
duet,

145
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,248
mixed duet,

146
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,377
and team categories.

147
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,708
Based on the Olympic standards and rules,

148
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:39,042
it has to be eight people in a team.

149
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:44,625
She is talking to all of you.

150
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,833
Can you guys focus?

151
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,248
Mr. Kui.

152
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,085
I have other training plans.

153
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:48,833
I'll get going.

154
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:49,417
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:50,168
I'll leave you to it.

156
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,542
Sorry for the trouble.

157
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,333
Mr. Kui.

158
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:53,748
Do we have to do this too?

159
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:55,085
They are all girls.

160
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,333
What's wrong with girls?

161
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:57,748
If girls can learn boxing,

162
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:59,168
why can't boys learn synchronized swimming?

163
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,168
Look carefully.

164
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:01,168
Look at their movements.

165
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:02,417
Look at the formations.

166
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:03,708
Don't look away.

167
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:18,002
It's unreliable.

168
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,002
What's wrong?

169
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:21,208
A few boys doing synchronized swimming.

170
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,542
Doesn't it feel strange?

171
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,125
Also, there are only five of us.

172
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:26,502
What about that?

173
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,377
How can the five of us slack off?

174
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,333
Besides, Mr. Kui mentioned a competition.

175
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,962
We will have to train for real then.

176
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:34,248
What should we do?

177
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:36,962
Let's go to a soccer team.

178
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:38,085
There are so many people.

179
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:39,625
Or a basketball team.

180
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:40,793
There are dozens of them.

181
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:41,917
Hey, guys.

182
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:42,962
Class is starting.

183
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:47,462
In this self study class,

184
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:49,377
let me share a way

185
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:51,877
of problem solving at the Nobel Prize level.

186
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:53,668
Come on.

187
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,125
Let's look at this hero.

188
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,585
Let's see how did he get the piece of weight

189
00:08:58,917 --> 00:08:59,877
to fall.

190
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:01,748
Let's take a look.

191
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:03,293
Click.

192
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,542
He cut it off

193
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,877
with a Blood Drinking Blade.

194
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:08,748
That's amazing.

195
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:10,502
Qu Xiaodong.

196
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:12,668
Where is he?

197
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:14,793
Where is he?

198
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:15,625
Excuse me.

199
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:17,877
Excuse me, sir.

200
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,542
We have training today.

201
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,125
Hurry up, Zhang Wei.

202
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,002
The coach will scold us if we are late.

203
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:25,833
Excuse me, Mr. Xia.

204
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:27,668
Mr. Xia, I'll see you tomorrow.

205
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:31,748
Didn't you say you won't go?

206
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:32,748
As long as we skip this class,

207
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:33,877
I'm fine with anything. Let's go.

208
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:40,585
This is great!

209
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:41,917
Captain, jump in!

210
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:42,748
Come on.

211
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:53,877
What are you doing?

212
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,125
I went to the bathroom.

213
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,502
What are you doing now?

214
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:57,585
I'm sitting down.

215
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:58,625
Sitting down?

216
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:00,585
Did I ask you to come here to sit down?

217
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,085
I'll pay for your clothes and wallet.

218
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:02,877
Let me go.

219
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:12,333
You! What are you doing as a captain?

220
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,668
Hurry up and gather at the starting point!

221
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,625
You two!

222
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,625
Gather at the starting point!

223
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,708
Listen to me.

224
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:33,417
You guys.

225
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,248
You must take this training seriously.

226
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,333
This will become

227
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:41,042
a very memorable lesson in your life.

228
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,042
You have to be brave.

229
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:44,462
You have to fight.

230
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:46,833
You have to be fearless.

231
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:48,708
Listen to my whistle.

232
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:50,333
Once you hear it,

233
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:51,585
do your best

234
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:52,708
and sprint to the other side.

235
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,585
Show me how outstanding you are.

236
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:56,417
All right?

237
00:10:57,877 --> 00:10:58,502
Get ready.

238
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,625
Focus your energy.

239
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,417
Ready.

240
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,877
Call me if you need anything.

241
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:13,917
Headmaster.

242
00:11:14,462 --> 00:11:14,877
That's right.

243
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:16,168
He has been taken to the hospital.

244
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:17,877
Xiaofu is with him.

245
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:20,002
I'll keep you posted.

246
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,248
Freedom!

247
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,502
In my notes,

248
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:49,708
there is your training plan.

249
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,625
You have to understand it.

250
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:53,917
Use it to lead the team and build the basics.

251
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:54,833
Get in the mood.

252
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,625
When the coach is absent,

253
00:11:57,877 --> 00:11:59,042
the captain is the coach.

254
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,502
Do you understand?

255
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:02,208
So as the captain,

256
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:03,668
you must take responsibility.

257
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:04,502
Do you hear me?

258
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,208
But I have never been a captain.

259
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,248
How should I take responsibility?

260
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,748
I have to lead our training too.

261
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,125
How can we train?

262
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:18,877
Zhang Wei!

263
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:19,962
Zhang Wei!

264
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:21,248
Let's race.

265
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:22,462
I'm busy.

266
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,085
It's not right if you don't get into the pool.

267
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:26,502
Chen Minghan!

268
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:28,168
Let's have a race.

269
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:29,042
Come.

270
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:30,333
Let's race again.

271
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,168
You won't do.

272
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,125
Let's hold our breaths.

273
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,833
The loser buys drinks.

274
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:35,793
Sure, let's do it.

275
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:37,168
You said it.

276
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:38,377
Won't you wish me good luck?

277
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,462
Just stay alive.

278
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:40,085
Ready.

279
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:42,333
One, two, three.

280
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:29,708
Mom and Dad are busy tonight.

281
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,833
I have to study.

282
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:32,208
Go home by yourself today.

283
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:36,793
Are they training?

284
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:38,877
I don't know.

285
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:44,542
Next time,make sure you have your keys with you.

286
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:50,877
Chen Minghan.

287
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,333
Who is it?

288
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:53,668
My elder sister.

289
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,002
You are good, kid.

290
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,248
You sure have a firm butt.

291
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:36,833
Come on.

292
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,668
Why did you kick me?

293
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:39,125
To buy you a drink.

294
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,748
Come on.

295
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:43,542
Don't go.

296
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,462
Buy me a drink.

297
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,833
Are you blind?

298
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,248
You are the one who is blind.

299
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:55,962
What are you doing?

300
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,585
We want to train.

301
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,585
We are training today.

302
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,085
You don't even have a coach.

303
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,417
What are you doing in the pool?

304
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:03,417
Hurry up and leave.

305
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:04,208
Kou Zi.

306
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,585
Talk to him nicely.

307
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:12,208
Hello.

308
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:13,417
I'm the captain of the swimming team.

309
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,462
Is your captain here?

310
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:16,625
What do you want?

311
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,168
I have something to discuss with him.

312
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,877
You can talk to me.

313
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:22,168
Why can't you talk to me?

314
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,333
What's wrong, Ququ?

315
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:24,917
This is our captain.

316
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:25,917
Say it then.

317
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:26,962
The thing is,

318
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,377
we are entering a competition.

319
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,377
Right now,our training time is tight.

320
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:32,085
You don't have a coach either.

321
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:34,417
Let us use the pool first.

322
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:35,168
Okay?

323
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,248
Thank you.

324
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:40,377
Let's go and train.

325
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,585
Why do you get the final say?

326
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,168
Or what?

327
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,542
Should we leave it for you to learn synchronized swimming?

328
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:54,168
Shake your butt.

329
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:55,668
Shake your upper body.

330
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,085
How sissy is that?

331
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,293
Stop right there!

332
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:01,917
Do you want a one on one fight?

333
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:02,793
Sure.

334
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,962
Do you dare to have a swimming race?

335
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:04,833
Yes.

336
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:05,962
The loser will have to leave.

337
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:07,085
The loser has to get lost.

338
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:07,585
Come on.

339
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:08,125
Come on.

340
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:08,502
Come on.

341
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:09,042
Come on.

342
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:09,585
Come on!

343
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:10,333
Zhang Wei!

344
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:14,417
Do it!

345
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:16,417
Don't give me that.

346
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:17,208
You are the captain.

347
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,002
Destroy him.

348
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:22,502
Kou Zi.

349
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,877
Leave them alone.

350
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,085
Xiaochong.

351
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:26,962
You should go.

352
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,542
You can do it, Captain!

353
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:31,248
Come on,

354
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:32,585
That's more than enough.

355
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:35,877
Ready.

356
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:38,748
Come on!

357
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:41,085
Captain!Come on!

358
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,333
Hurry up, Zhang Wei!

359
00:17:58,793 --> 00:17:59,668
What's wrong, Zhang Wei?

360
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:02,625
Why did you climb up there?

361
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,668
What's happening?

362
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,542
What's wrong with you, Zhang Wei?

363
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,748
He has a cramp!

364
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:08,877
You can't do it, can you?

365
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,042
Who can't do it?

366
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,042
He can't do it.

367
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,085
Can you do it?

368
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:12,668
I can do it.

369
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:13,417
Do you dare to compete with us?

370
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,208
Come on.

371
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:14,877
Do you dare to compete with us?

372
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:15,502
Come on! Let's go!

373
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:16,417
Anyone of you.

374
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:16,962
Come on!

375
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:17,248
Ready.

376
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:18,042
Aren't you being unreasonable?

377
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:19,708
Let's go.

378
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,542
Captain of the swimming team,

379
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,333
let's race.

380
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:30,748
What?

381
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:32,502
Let's race.

382
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:34,962
Excuse me.

383
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,585
This is going on forever.

384
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:38,962
Choose between 100 and 200 m.

385
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,293
All right.

386
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:43,293
200 m.

387
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,333
You really have to leave if you lose this time.

388
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,168
On your mark.

389
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:15,293
Get set.

390
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,333
Go for it!

391
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,625
Gao Fei,Go for it!

392
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:49,668
Gao Fei! We're leading!

393
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,833
That's incredible!

394
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,002
Stay strong, Gao Fei!

395
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:19,962
Stay strong,

396
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:23,625
The captain is overtaking you.

397
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,542
Nicely done!

398
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:30,502
Rise powerfully!

399
00:20:30,502 --> 00:20:31,125
Soar to the top!

400
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:31,668
Steady,

401
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:32,293
Soar to the top, Gao Fei!

402
00:20:58,085 --> 00:20:59,585
Gao Fei! Go for it, Gao Fei!

403
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,333
Come forward, Gao Fei!

404
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,168
Sprint forward!

405
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:03,793
Keep steady!

406
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,917
That's amazing.

407
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:16,168
That's amazing, Gao Fei!

408
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,625
That's awesome!

409
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,462
That's awesome!

410
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,793
Is there anyone else who wants a race?

411
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,748
Then don't just stand there.

412
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,085
Let's go.

413
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:54,708
You are leaving?

414
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:55,708
It's okay.

415
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,585
That was great.

416
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:57,542
Keep it up.

417
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:58,793
Let's race again next time.

418
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:00,293
Good luck.

419
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,542
Gao Fei, you are amazing!

420
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:03,625
Teach me how to swim.

421
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:05,333
Have you trained before?

422
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,542
Can you teach me?

423
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:08,293
I'll buy you a drink.

424
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,333
You can choose any drink.

425
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:11,625
Gao Fei. Is that all right?

426
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,002
I'll take your silence as a yes.

427
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:15,377
Master.

428
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,877
He is amazing!

429
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,585
He is amazing!

430
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,042
A captain

431
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,502
should be someone like him.

432
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,377
They want to rob our territory?

433
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:32,793
Go against them.

434
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:33,917
We won't give in to anyone.

435
00:22:34,248 --> 00:22:34,962
Our synchronized swimming team

436
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,377
must not panic and must stay together.

437
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:38,708
You are the captain.

438
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:39,962
No matter what happens,

439
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:41,248
you have to hang in there.

440
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,417
You must know.

441
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:44,625
This will become

442
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,793
a very memorable lesson in your life.

443
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:48,333
So you should cherish it,

444
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:49,293
fight on,

445
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:49,748
and?

446
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,293
Miss!

447
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,708
Mr. Kui.

448
00:22:58,248 --> 00:22:59,168
